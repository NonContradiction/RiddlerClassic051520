    "\n",
    "You are creating a variation of a Romulan pixmit deck. Each card is an equilateral triangle, with one of the digits 0 through 9 (written in Romulan, of course) at the base of each side of the card. No number appears more than once on each card. Furthermore, every card in the deck is unique, meaning no card can be rotated so that it matches (i.e., can be superimposed on) any other card.\n",

    "In the base problem, each of our cards is going to feature three distinct numbers of our ten unique numbers, so we begin by computing the quantity ${10 \\choose 3}$. Moreover, for each possible combination, we may arrange them as many times as we can provided that each card is unique under rotation. Now, each card will have 3 elements and therefore $3! = 6$ permutations, and it is clear that for a given permutation it may be cycled into 2 more orientations (e.g. 1,2,3; 2,3,1; 3,1,2), hence our number of ${10 \\choose 3}$ combinations will get multiplied by $\\frac{6}{3} = 2$, for a closed form expression of \n",
